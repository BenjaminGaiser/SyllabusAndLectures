## <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-up"></i> Objectives for the week

- Collaborative Research Project

- Peer discussion/feedback

- Further work on Collaborative Research Project

## EU public data source

<br>
<br>
<br>

Publicdata.eu might be a useful source of data for future projects:

<http://publicdata.eu/>

## Collaborative Research Project (1)

**Purposes**: Pose an interesting research question and try to answer it using
data analysis and standard academic practices. Effectively communicate your
results to a **variety of audiences** in a **variety of formats**.

**Deadline**:

- Presentation: In-class 4 December

- Website/Paper: 11 December

## Collaborative Research Project (2)

The project can be thought of as a 'dry run' for your thesis with multiple 
presentation outputs.

Presentation: 10 minutes **maximum**. **Engagingly** present your research
question and key findings to a general academic audience (fellow students).

Paper: 6,000 words maximum. **Standard academic paper**, properly cited laying out
your research question, literature review, data, methods, and findings.

Website: An engaging website designed to convey your research to **a general
audience**.

## Collaborative Research Project (3)

As always, you should **submit one GitHub repository** with all of the
materials needed to **completely reproduce** your data gathering, analysis, and
presentation documents.

**Note**: Because you've had two assignments already to work on parts of the
project, I expect **high quality work**.

## Collaborative Research Project (3)

Find one other group to be a **discussant** for your presentation.

The discussants will provide a quick (max 2 minute) critique of your 
presentation--ideas for things you can improve on your paper.

## Peer discussion/feedback

**First**: take ~12 minutes to come up with a **five minute pitch** for your project:

- What is your research question? Why is it interesting?

- What data did you gather/methods did you use?

- What are your results? How do you plan to present these?

- What issue do you still have/questions you want to ask?

**Second**: Pair with *one* other group and **give your pitch** + **ask** the
other pair **at least two questions** about their project.

**Third**: Show the other group **your GitHub repo**. Explain how it is
**organised**. Pick one file and **explain what this file does** in detail.

## Final Stretch

<br>
<br>
<br>

Work on your project.

Ask me/other groups questions.
