## No PDF this Week

This week there is no PDF version of the lecture slides (this is for weird technical reasons that might become clearer after the lecture).

You have a few options to view the lecture slides:

1. Remember HTML files are just text files. Open the **RAW** version of the Lecture4.html file. Copy it into a blank text file. Save it. Then just open the file with a web browser. 

2. Click on the little computer screen icon on the upper right above the Lecture4.html file (Open in GitHub for Mac/Windows). This will open it directly on your desktop. Caveat: I think this will only work if you've already forked the repo.

3. Open the Lecture4.Rmd file in RStudio. Then click "Knit HTML". This will compile the R markdown file into HTML. We will in fact learn more about this in Lecture 4.
